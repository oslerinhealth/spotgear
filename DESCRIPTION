Description: In many diseases, the targets of autoantibodies are
        incompletely defined. Although the technologies for
        autoantibody discovery have advanced dramatically over the past
        decade, each of these techniques generates hundreds of
        possibilities, which are onerous and expensive to validate. We
        set out to establish a method to greatly simplify autoantibody
        discovery, using a pre-filtering step to define subgroups with
        similar specificities based on migration of radiolabeled,
        immunoprecipitated proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
        gels and autoradiography [Gel Electrophoresis and band
        detection on Autoradiograms (GEA)]. Human recognition of
        patterns is not optimal when the patterns are complex or
        scattered across many samples. Multiple sources of errors -
        including irrelevant intensity differences and warping of gels
        - have challenged automation of pattern discovery from
        autoradiograms. In this package, we address these limitations
        using a Bayesian hierarchical model with shrinkage priors for
        pattern alignment and spatial dewarping. The Bayesian model
        combines information from multiple gel sets and corrects
        spatial warping for coherent estimation of autoantibody
        signatures defined by presence or absence of a grid of landmark
        proteins. The pre-processing method creates more clearly
        separated clusters and improves the accuracy of autoantibody
        subset detection via hierarchical clustering.
